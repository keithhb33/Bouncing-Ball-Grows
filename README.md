# Bouncing Ball Simulation

Python simulation featuring a dynamically interactive bouncing ball. The simulation demonstrates a ball that bounces, grows in size, and accelerates each time it hits the boundary of a surrounding circle, showcasing basic principles of physics and object interaction within a defined environment.

## Key Features

- **Collision Detection**: The simulation detects collisions between the ball and the circular boundary.
- **Dynamic Response**: Post-collision, the ball increases in size, and the speed of its movement accelerates.
- **Gravity Effect**: The simulation includes a gravity effect influencing the ball's movement.
